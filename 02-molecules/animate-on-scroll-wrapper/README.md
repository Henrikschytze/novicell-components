You can put anything inside of this wrapper that you wish to animate. As you render animate-on-scroll-wrapper, you can pass it specific data-aos attributes, such as animation, delay and duration.
The default animation for the wrapper is "zoom-out". A good example of its application can be found under the page: aos-page.
Please refer to aos.js documentation for further explanation of the different data-aos attributes
!!IMPORTANT
Please note that animations such as flip-up are not supported by IE. Some code will have to detect IE and alter the passed animation attribute if neccesary
